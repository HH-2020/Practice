# GANs

This project aims on converting one domain 256x265 RGB images to another domain 256x256 RGB images. (Using Denoising dirty documents datasets)

By now, only a normal GAN model was completed. (Generator is based on autoencoder , discriminator is build only by convolution layer.)
DCGAN, CycleGAN, ProgressiveGAN, StyleGAN will be complete in future.
